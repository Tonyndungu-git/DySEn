## Project Overview
DYSEN Chat is a collaborative web platform designed for dynamical systems enthusiasts to share ideas, concepts, and engage in discussions. Inspired by the functionality of the Tweetme_2 project by codingentrepreneurs, DYSEN Chat integrates features like comments, likes, tweets, and retweets. Developed as a full-stack project, it leverages technologies such as Django, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.js to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Backend Development:** Gain hands-on experience in backend development using Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework. Explore concepts such as authentication, permissions, forms, views, and admin functionalities.

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Progress from basic frontend technologies like JavaScript and HTML to advanced development using React.js. The goal is to create a fully functional chat platform while enhancing web development skills.

## Technologies Used
1. **Django:** Backend development and server-side logic.
2. **Django Rest Framework:** Building RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
3. **Bootstrap:** Frontend styling and responsive design.
4. **JavaScript:** Implementing basic frontend interactions and asynchronous communication with the backend.
5. **React.js:** Advanced frontend development for a dynamic user interface.

## Identified Challenges
1. **Smooth Data Flow:**
   - Ensure seamless data flow between the frontend and backend to support real-time interactions.

2. **Choice of Views (Class Views vs. Function Views):**
   - Decide on using class-based views or function-based views in Django for improved code organization and maintainability.

3. **Debugging:**
   - Anticipate the need for extensive debugging, particularly during the integration phase, to address potential issues.

## Project Management
- **Timeline:** 27-day project divided into development, testing, and deployment phases.
- **Task Management:** Utilize a Trello board to breakdown tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress.
- **Sprints:** Organize the schedule into sprints, aiming to complete specific features and functionalities within each sprint.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase:** Development
- **Next Milestone:** Completion of core features
